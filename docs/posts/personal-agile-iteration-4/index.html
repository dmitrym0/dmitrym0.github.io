        <p>Interesting iteration. Overall agile approach has been a net positive. I likely would&rsquo;ve have been approximately as successful, but deliberate approach to planning and reviews yields interesting artifacts (of which this blog post is one) and provides for an interesting trajectory overview.</p>
<p>I made good progress on my tasks this iteration:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding two additional chapters reviewed to &ldquo;First 90 days&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s becoming a bit tedious, but I feel it&rsquo;s critical to finish this book.</li>
<li>moving forward with my <code>org-friend</code> SwiftUI project.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of my application, I feel like I&rsquo;ve committed two cardinal sins of software engineering</p>
<ol>
<li>I started gold plating.</li>
<li>I added more work to an iteration that&rsquo;s already in progress.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scope-creep-and-gold-plating">Scope creep and gold plating</h2>
<p>When I initially started this project, the goal was a really simple utility application. Which means minimal UI. However as things progressed, it became apparent that there needs to be a splash screen, a settings screen and a &ldquo;log view&rdquo;. Even though the fundamentally the application has been working since the second iteration, I haven&rsquo;t been happy with the overall visual appearance. So I&rsquo;m working on that now. I reached out to some folks that I know, but they are busy. I approach some contractors on Fiverr with some success. In any case, the takeaway here is that suddenly I&rsquo;m spending more time on look and feel for an application that&rsquo;s supposed to spend most of it&rsquo;s time in the background. The justification I use is that since this is a showcase for my work, a portfolio piece, I want it to look nice. First impressions and all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a UI designed by a developer. No good.</p>

<h2 id="adding-work-to-an-iteration-in-progress">Adding work to an iteration in progress</h2>
<p>I got mixed feelings about this one. Personally I don&rsquo;t think this is a huge problem if negotiated properly. In a team of 1 it&rsquo;s really easy. In a larger team this would have to be managed very carefully and be an exception. I&rsquo;m doing this for fun largely so I roll with it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall a healthy and productive iteration. I made progress on both of my little projects. One area where I hope to improve is time tracking. I know I&rsquo;m missing time here. This is largely the function of learning Emacs.</p>
