      <title>Achievement Unlocked: Open Source Contribution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did it. My Emacs package, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dmitrym0/org-hyperscheduler&#34;&gt;org-hyperscheduler&lt;/a&gt;, is now live on MELPA, &lt;a href=&#34;https://melpa.org/#/org-hyperscheduler&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m overjoyed. It&amp;rsquo;s a big deal for me, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time beneficiary of open source software and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to finally be able to give back. It&amp;rsquo;s the first piece of software that I started out writing for myself and got to a state where it&amp;rsquo;s useable for other folks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once version 1 was stable, I submitted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/8057&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to MELPA. Prior to that I ran through their &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org&#34;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt;. The checklist ensures that style guides are followed, deployment recipe works correctly, etc. Even though I went through the checklist twice, I still managed to miss a couple of things. The reviewer kindly pointed it out:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Journaling prompts in Emacs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my daily rituals is journaling. It&amp;rsquo;s been shown to have positive impact on quality of life (citation needed). I find it helps me decompress but it&amp;rsquo;s also a permanent record of my thoughts and my life&amp;rsquo;s minutiae.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually set a timer for 5 minutes and go to town. One particular challenge I have, is that some times I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to write about. Recently I came upon the idea of journaling prompts. So far, journaling prompts come in the form of questions:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is hyper-scheduling?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hyperscheduling-tldr&#34;&gt;Hyperscheduling?; TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hyperscheduling is the idea of fully planning your day using a calendar. Every minute of the day is assigned to some task using a calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;hyperscheduling-in-more-detail&#34;&gt;Hyperscheduling in more detail&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hyperscheduling is only part of a productivity system. It helps me plan my day:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Select a set of tasks for today (this is done outside of hyperscheduling, using GTD or another system).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prioritize your tasks in order of importance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lay your tasks out on the calendar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step #3 is where the magic is. By visually moving time blocks around on a calendar, I get the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Note taking and discovery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking notes consistently, probably starting in university. The challenge for me was never capture but retrieval. I suspect that&amp;rsquo;s true for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about zettelcasten is how Luhramn optimized his sytem for retrieval. Related subjects were proximate, he used a linking system of sorts that allowed his cards to be filed under number of different topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In digital note taking, proximity is difficult to simulate. Hyperlinking is the first step of course. My problem with hyperlinks is that they become lost in the content of the note. The only way to discover them is by scanning the text. This is very slow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Omnifocus style reviews with org-mode</title>
      <link>https://dmitrym.online/posts/omnifocus-review-with-org-mode/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrym.online/posts/omnifocus-review-with-org-mode/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using Emacs and org-mode in earnest in the middle of 2019. At that point in time I was using Omnifocus to track my tasks and Bearapp for notes. I was missing&#xA;plaintext functionality. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced most of the functionality that Omnifocus offerred except one particular feature: reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In GTD, reviews occupy a pretty important niche. Without regular task and project reviews task lists tend to grow out of control and become polutted. One important consideration for a&#xA;task list is for it to closely resemble the actual state of what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
