      <description>Unfortunately melpa does not provide download counts for org-noter. This is an attempt to keep a manual record.
It&amp;rsquo;s also hard to differentiate between new installs and upgrades. In any case it&amp;rsquo;s some indication of usage.
Date Count Feb 27, 2022 32000 Aug 11, 2023 50000 Feb 21, 2024 61000 It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note that the version in 2022 was marked 2019 so the doubling of downloads in 2 years is likely due to updates.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed to open source software much until last year. It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting and rewarding process.
My first large contribution was last year when I released my scheduling package for Emacs, org-hyperscheduler. Later in 2022 I found a fantastic package for taking notes, org-noter.
When I dicovered org-noter in the summer of 2022, it was not actively maintained. The last update was at the end of 2019. I asked if anyone wanted to collaborate on a fork on github and made a post on reddit.</description>
