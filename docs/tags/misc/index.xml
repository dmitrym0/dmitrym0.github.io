      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Bose QuietComfort35s since 2017. I use it both for music, connected to my iPhone and for work calls. One issue is that when a call comes through on my phone, the audio is disconnected from my Macbook. This is very inconvenient during a work Google Meet call. I have to scramble then to reconnect the audio to my meeting.
I&amp;rsquo;m fixing this with an AppleScript + Apple Shortcut combo.</description>

      <description>One of my daily rituals is journaling. It&amp;rsquo;s been shown to have positive impact on quality of life (citation needed). I find it helps me decompress but it&amp;rsquo;s also a permanent record of my thoughts and my life&amp;rsquo;s minutiae.
I usually set a timer for 5 minutes and go to town. One particular challenge I have, is that some times I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to write about. Recently I came upon the idea of journaling prompts.</description>
