At some point harddrive space was cheap, but with the advent of SSDs and cheap "Cloud VMs" that is no longer the case. For example, the cheapest VM on VULTR is $5/month and has a 15 gig SSD drive. It's suddenly very important to maximize drive usage again. This is where [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) comes in. It displays a nice ncurses interface that visualizes the usage breakdown.

So useful key bindings:

- `?` - help
- `g` - to switch display modes
- `d` - to kill a subdirectory tree

There's a commercial app for Mac that I use and love (because my Mac only has a 256 SSD) called [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com/).
