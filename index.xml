      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed to open source software much until last year. It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting and rewarding process.
Last year when I released my scheduling package for Emacs, org-hyperscheduler. Later in 2022 I found a fantastic package for taking notes, org-noter.
When I dicovered org-noter in the summer of 2022, it was not actively maintained. The last update was at the end of 2019. I asked if anyone wanted to collaborate on a fork on github and made a post on reddit.</description>

      <title>Achievement Unlocked: Open Source Contribution</title>

      <description>I did it. My Emacs package, org-hyperscheduler, is now live on MELPA, here.
I&amp;rsquo;m overjoyed. It&amp;rsquo;s a big deal for me, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time beneficiary of open source software and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to finally be able to give back. It&amp;rsquo;s the first piece of software that I started out writing for myself and got to a state where it&amp;rsquo;s useable for other folks.
Once version 1 was stable, I submitted a pull request to MELPA.</description>

      <title>Journaling prompts in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/journaling-prompts-with-emacs/</link>

      <description>One of my daily rituals is journaling. It&amp;rsquo;s been shown to have positive impact on quality of life (citation needed). I find it helps me decompress but it&amp;rsquo;s also a permanent record of my thoughts and my life&amp;rsquo;s minutiae.
I usually set a timer for 5 minutes and go to town. One particular challenge I have, is that some times I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to write about. Recently I came upon the idea of journaling prompts.</description>

      <title>Caddy 2 and TCP Proxying</title>
      <link>https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/caddy2-and-tcp-proxying/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/caddy2-and-tcp-proxying/</guid>
      <description>How to configure Caddy2 to proxy TCP streams.
To illustrate the architecture, I have the following entities running in Docker.
I&amp;rsquo;m using Caddy 2 as a reverse proxy, but it looks like it supports many more scenarios. Previously I used nginx, or traeffic. The appeal of Caddy is that it supports TLS (with LetsEncrypt) out of the box and integrates with Consul for an eventual clustering solution with Nomad.
Startup with Caddy was very simple.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking notes consistently, probably starting in university. The challenge for me was never capture but retrieval. I suspect that&amp;rsquo;s true for most people.
The interesting thing about zettelcasten is how Luhramn optimized his sytem for retrieval. Related subjects were proximate, he used a linking system of sorts that allowed his cards to be filed under number of different topics.
In digital note taking, proximity is difficult to simulate. Hyperlinking is the first step of course.</description>

      <description>Nearly a year after my previous entry, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get into blogging yet again. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a huge backlog of posts I&amp;rsquo;m interested in sharing but it&amp;rsquo;s been a challenge to get through it for various reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s not New Year&amp;rsquo;s, but here&amp;rsquo;s a commitment, write one post every two weeks. Should be doable?</description>

      <title>  Book review: &#34;First 90 days&#34;

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;First 90 days&amp;rdquo; lays out a comprehensive plan on how to become productive in a new role, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a promotion or a position in a new company.
Itâ€™s a mistake to believe that you will be successful in your new job by continuing to do what you did in your previous job, only more so
The advice is wide ranging. What&amp;rsquo;s useful about this book is that there&amp;rsquo;s nearly a step by step process for every category of advice.</description>

      <title>Personal Agile: Iteration 5 (COVID-19 edition)</title>
      <link>https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/personal-agile-iteration-5/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been pretty hard to focus on anything other than what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world the last two weeks. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really successfully complete the iteration. We&amp;rsquo;ve been sent home from work about a week ago which freed up a lot of time that&amp;rsquo;s been allocated to the commute. Theoretically. Unfortunately focus has been hard to come by.
The only take away I have from this iteration is that I&amp;rsquo;ve significantly reversed my position on UI/UX.</description>

      <description>Interesting iteration. Overall agile approach has been a net positive. I likely would&amp;rsquo;ve have been approximately as successful, but deliberate approach to planning and reviews yields interesting artifacts (of which this blog post is one) and provides for an interesting trajectory overview.
I made good progress on my tasks this iteration:
adding two additional chapters reviewed to &amp;ldquo;First 90 days&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s becoming a bit tedious, but I feel it&amp;rsquo;s critical to finish this book.</description>

      <description>The goal for this iteration was to:
work on my little SwiftUI app finish reading a book (&amp;ldquo;The first 90 days&amp;rdquo;) maintain my fitness habits Conclusions Overall the iteration went well. In the screenshot above, you can tell that I wildly underestimated how much time summarizing the current book would take: I estimated an hour, but it ended up being 3 times as much (3 hours).
Then, I spent way too much on my app, 10 pomodoros (roughly 5 hours) vs 3 hours initially estimated.</description>

      <title>Omnifocus style reviews with org-mode</title>
      <link>https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/omnifocus-review-with-org-mode/</link>

      <guid>https://dmitrym0.github.io/posts/omnifocus-review-with-org-mode/</guid>
      <description>I started using Emacs and org-mode in earnest in the middle of 2019. At that point in time I was using Omnifocus to track my tasks and Bearapp for notes. I was missing plaintext functionality. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced most of the functionality that Omnifocus offerred except one particular feature: reviews.
In GTD, reviews occupy a pretty important niche. Without regular task and project reviews task lists tend to grow out of control and become polutted.</description>

      <title>RAID5: Recovering from 2-drive failure during rebuild</title>

      <description>RAID is amazing technology. It lets us take a bunch of cheap disks an arrange them in various configurations that present these disks as one large disk. A particularly popular type of RAID for home users is RAID5. A RAID5 array is typically comprised of 3 disks, however only 2/3 of the disk space is available since 1/3 of the space is used for recovery purposes if one of the disks fail.</description>
