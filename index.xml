		<description><![CDATA[<h1>efficient commit workflow with tig</h1>
<p>One of the recommended source control practices is to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107264/how-often-to-commit-changes-to-source-control">commit frequently, and often</a>.   I prefer to keep my commits terse and focused, however in practice I’m working on a couple related but independent things in parallel. At commit time, I prefer to tease loosely related things apart and commit them separately. </p>
<p>One way to do that is with the interactive git-add facility that can be invoked with <code>git add -p</code>:</p>
<img src="images/885D7D62-4C88-470D-9745-DA5202080E5B.png">
<p>It’s a lovely little interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>file name is shown at the top of the output</li>
<li>location of the change set is shown</li>
<li>the prompt is asking whether I want to stage the change (“y”),  ignore the changes this file (“d”) and various other obscure options.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process works for the majority of my commit needs. It allows me to review every change before staging it to ensure that only necessary changes get pushed to the central repo.</p>
<p>My main issue with this process is that it’s too linear. When the number of changes exceeds a certain threshold I have trouble remembering what functionality I’m currently committing. I can’t easily inspect the existing staged hunks. The process becomes cumbersome. </p>
<p>This is where <a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/">tig</a>, a <em>text-mode interface for Git</em> comes in. I’m a huge fan of console tools because they are incredibly fast and <em>tig</em> is no exception. </p>
<p>Upon launching <em>tig</em> you’re presented with the following view:</p>
<img src="images/52EF34AA-B701-4F45-8CF3-639718C7A16B.png">
<p>I’m currently interested in the “unstaged changes”. Hitting <code>enter</code> shows a diff between HEAD and current working directory. </p>
<p>But we’re interested more in the stage view that can be activated by hitting <code>S</code> (case matters!):</p>
<img src="images/40535893-241B-465B-BDBB-1E547CD9F686.png">
<p>This view should be familiar to anyone who has used <code>git status</code>.  This main view can be navigated with arrow keys. Hitting <code>enter</code> on a file name  will show a secondary window with a diff. This view can be navigated with the <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> keys (vi-like).</p>
<img src="images/845B9D78-DC30-4AFF-9504-B8EFE7E2BF0D.png">
<p>At this point, we can select individuals lines to stage with the <code>1</code> key, or hit <code>u</code> to stage the whole file.  Individual lines can be staged when there’s some cruft you don’t want to commit - such as debugging statements.</p>
<p>When all changes have been staged, you can hit  <code>C</code> to commit from inside <em>tig</em>, or exit (<code>q</code>) and commit as you normally would from command line.</p>
<p>Here’s a small <a href="http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/tig.html">Tig cheatsheet</a>  for reference.</p>]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[XTerra Switched outlet]]></title>
		<description><![CDATA[<h1>XTerra Switched outlet</h1>
<p>For some reason <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=why+are+truck+12v+always+on">truck and SUV 12v outlets are always hot</a>.  This is true in my wife’s F150 and my 2010 Nissan XTerra. This is a bit of annoyance since I’d like to use a bluetooth transmitter to connect my iPhone to the radio. Thankfully, it’s fairly easy to add a second, switched outlet in the XTerra.</p>
<p>The short  of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>acquire OEM cigarette outlet </li>
<li>wire it via an add-a-fuse </li>
</ul>
<p>As far as electrical mods go this one is very mild and simple. The biggest difficulty for me was managing to sneak a bolt behind the glove box to ground the connection.</p>
<p><strong>Please note. This mod involves electricity. Electricity is dangerous.  It could destroy your vehicle and potentially kill you.</strong> </p>
<img src="images/213587C8-4B2D-4469-A568-C658712B8D74.png">
<h2>Step 1: Acquire all of the parts</h2>
<p>This is not a complete list since I’ve had some of this stuff already.</p>
<p>What’ you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nissan OEM part 253369B92A, the ring protector. This is the plastic piece that clips into the dash and holds the metal part of the cigarette lighter. Can be purchased at <a href="https://nissanpartswarehouse.com/">NissanPartsWarehouse.com</a></li>
<li>Nissan OEM part 25339ZV60A, the metal part of the cigarette lighter. Can be purchased <a href="https://nissanpartswarehouse.com/">NissanPartsWarehouse.com</a>.</li>
<li>One add-a-fuse</li>
<li>Some automotive wiring. 18 gauge wiring should be fine. </li>
<li>(1) Ring terminal for the ground wire. </li>
<li>(2) Blade terminals to connect on the back of the cigarette lighters</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/IMG_7683.JPG">
<h2>Step 2: Putting it all together</h2>
<p>This is actually quite straightforward.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a necessary length (about a foot?) to the add-a-fuse wire and crimp it. Add a blade terminal to the other end. This is the hot wire. It will connect to the centre pin of the cigarette lighter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the ground wire, take a short length, put a ring terminal on one end, and a blade terminal on the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect blade terminals to the cigarette lighter. Centre is hot and goes to the fuse box. Side pin is ground.  I should’ve probably used two different colours. </p>
<img src="images/IMG_7684.JPG">
</li>
<li>
<p>Thread the wires through the exposed mounting hole. DO NOT push the cigarette lighter all the way in until you’ve confirmed that everything is wired correctly. </p>
<img src="images/IMG_7685.JPG">
</li>
<li>
<p>On the right, plug your add-a-fuse into the heated seats fuse position. It’s unused and is only live when the engine is turned on (not my picture)</p>
<img src="images/lighter004.jpg">
</li>
<li>
<p>On the left, ground the connection to a metal post directly behind cigarette lighter hole. This will be difficult because it’s tight in there. I used a small nut and bolt. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally test with a multimeter to ensure that everything is correct and pop the cigarette lighter all the way in.</p>
<img src="images/IMG_7687.JPG">
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, not a difficult mod at all. Requires some wiring knowledge. The total cost was about $20 for the OEM cigarette lighter parts, another $10 for add a fuse and the rest of the miscellanea I had at home. Not too bad. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[<h1>ncdu - ncurses disk usage</h1>
<img src="images/C4E2CBC7-B430-42C7-A97B-29C687793DA3.png">
<p>At some point harddrive space was cheap, but with the advent of SSDs and cheap “Cloud VMs” that is no longer the case. For example, the cheapest VM on VULTR is $5/month and has a 15 gig SSD drive. It's suddenly very important to maximize drive usage again. This is where <a href="https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu">ncdu</a> comes in. It displays a nice ncurses interface that visualizes the usage breakdown.</p>
<p>So useful key bindings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>?</code> - help</li>
<li><code>g</code> - to switch display modes</li>
<li><code>d</code> - to kill a subdirectory tree</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a commercial app for Mac that I use and love (because my Mac only has a 256 SSD) called <a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/">DaisyDisk</a>.</p>
