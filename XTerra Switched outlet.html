				<h1>XTerra Switched outlet</h1>
<p>For some reason <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=why+are+truck+12v+always+on">truck and SUV 12v outlets are always hot</a>.  This is true in my wife’s F150 and my 2010 Nissan XTerra. This is a bit of annoyance since I’d like to use a bluetooth transmitter to connect my iPhone to the radio. Thankfully, it’s fairly easy to add a second, switched outlet in the XTerra.</p>
<p>The short  of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>acquire OEM cigarette outlet </li>
<li>wire it via an add-a-fuse </li>
</ul>
<p>As far as electrical mods go this one is very mild and simple. The biggest difficulty for me was managing to sneak a bolt behind the glove box to ground the connection.</p>
<p><strong>Please note. This mod involves electricity. Electricity is dangerous.  It could destroy your vehicle and potentially kill you.</strong> </p>

<h2>Step 1: Acquire all of the parts</h2>
<p>This is not a complete list since I’ve had some of this stuff already.</p>
<p>What’ you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nissan OEM part 253369B92A, the ring protector. This is the plastic piece that clips into the dash and holds the metal part of the cigarette lighter. Can be purchased at <a href="https://nissanpartswarehouse.com/">NissanPartsWarehouse.com</a></li>
<li>Nissan OEM part 25339ZV60A, the metal part of the cigarette lighter. Can be purchased <a href="https://nissanpartswarehouse.com/">NissanPartsWarehouse.com</a>.</li>
<li>One add-a-fuse</li>
<li>Some automotive wiring. 18 gauge wiring should be fine. </li>
<li>(1) Ring terminal for the ground wire. </li>
<li>(2) Blade terminals to connect on the back of the cigarette lighters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Putting it all together</h2>
<p>This is actually quite straightforward.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a necessary length (about a foot?) to the add-a-fuse wire and crimp it. Add a blade terminal to the other end. This is the hot wire. It will connect to the centre pin of the cigarette lighter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the ground wire, take a short length, put a ring terminal on one end, and a blade terminal on the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect blade terminals to the cigarette lighter. Centre is hot and goes to the fuse box. Side pin is ground.  I should’ve probably used two different colours. </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Thread the wires through the exposed mounting hole. DO NOT push the cigarette lighter all the way in until you’ve confirmed that everything is wired correctly. </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>On the right, plug your add-a-fuse into the heated seats fuse position. It’s unused and is only live when the engine is turned on (not my picture)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>On the left, ground the connection to a metal post directly behind cigarette lighter hole. This will be difficult because it’s tight in there. I used a small nut and bolt. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally test with a multimeter to ensure that everything is correct and pop the cigarette lighter all the way in.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, not a difficult mod at all. Requires some wiring knowledge. The total cost was about $20 for the OEM cigarette lighter parts, another $10 for add a fuse and the rest of the miscellanea I had at home. Not too bad. </p>
