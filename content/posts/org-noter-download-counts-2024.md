Unfortunately [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/?q=org-noter) does not provide download counts for [org-noter](https://github.com/org-noter/org-noter). This is an attempt to keep a manual record.

It's also hard to differentiate between new installs and upgrades. In any case it's some indication of usage.

| Date         | Count                                                                           |

It's interesting to note that the version in 2022 was marked 2019 so the doubling of downloads in 2 years is likely due to updates.
