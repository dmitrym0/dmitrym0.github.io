The goal for this iteration was to:

-   work on my little SwiftUI app
-   finish reading a book ("The first 90 days")
-   maintain my fitness habits

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

Overall the iteration went well. In the screenshot above, you can tell that I wildly underestimated how much time summarizing the current book would take: I estimated an hour, but it ended up being 3 times as much (3 hours).

Then, I spent way too much on my app, 10 pomodoros (roughly 5 hours) vs 3 hours initially estimated.

The big fitness goals (workouts) were met, but smaller (morning stretches) didn't pan out. Oh well.

I also forgot to add time to plan for the next iteration, although I did include a task to create a template (which I didn't do).

So, moving forward:

-   create an iteration template (that should include: estimation task and postmortem task).
-   record the velocity (current sprint is somewhat unusual: I'm on vacation).
-   be very careful of over-committing. Err on the side of not having enough work (to avoid guilt etc).
