Nearly a year after my previous entry, I'm trying to get into blogging yet again. I've got a huge backlog of posts I'm interested in sharing but it's been a challenge to get through it for various reasons. It's not New Year's, but here's a commitment, write one post every two weeks. Should be doable?
