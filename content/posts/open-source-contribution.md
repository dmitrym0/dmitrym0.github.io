I did it. My Emacs package, [org-hyperscheduler](https://github.com/dmitrym0/org-hyperscheduler), is now live on MELPA, [here](https://melpa.org/#/org-hyperscheduler).

I'm overjoyed. It's a big deal for me, because I've been a long time beneficiary of open source software and I'm glad to finally be able to give back. It's the first piece of software that I started out writing for myself and got to a state where it's useable for other folks.

Once version 1 was stable, I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/8057) to MELPA. Prior to that I ran through their [checklist](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org). The checklist ensures that style guides are followed, deployment recipe works correctly, etc. Even though I went through the checklist twice, I still managed to miss a couple of things. The reviewer kindly pointed it out:

A few more rounds of back and forth and:

As of July 25, MELPA shows 37 downloads. There are 85 stars on github (and 5 forks):

There is an ocassional [issue](https://github.com/dmitrym0/org-hyperscheduler/issues/19) being submitted via GitHub, so the package is being used.

As a software engineer this makes me very happy.
