I published my [tircd branch](https://github.com/dmitrym0/tircd). If you're
unfamiliar with [tircd](https://code.google.com/p/tircd/) it's a daemon that
presents Twitter as an IRC channel. I merged [this really old branch](https://github.com/DexterTheDragon/tircd) that implements Twitter lists
as channels with the semi official [google code mirror branch](https://github.com/drags/tircd).  I created a [pull request](https://github.com/drags/tircd/pull/1) but it hasn't been acted on yet.

I consume my instant messaging via IRC (with the help of
[minbif](https://symlink.me/projects/minbif/wiki)) and now Twitter too. Quite
convenient.

This is what my Twitter looks like right now:
