				<h1>Building a lithium ion battery, part 1: “Why”</h1>
<p>Why build a battery? Why build a battery from scratch? I’ll tell you.</p>
<h2>Why build a battery from scratch?</h2>
<p>Battery technology is becoming very important. Cell phones, laptops and now cars rely on batteries for power. More importantly, I needed a battery unit for reasons (more on this later). </p>
<p>I could’ve purchased a battery off the shelf, but consumer units are quite expensive. For example [<a href="https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5055-474/Yeti-400-Lithium">Goal Zero Yeti 400 Lithium</a> is $800. I thought I could build one for about a 1/3 of the price. </p>
<p>I was also curious to understand how modern lithium batteries work. So really, the combination of wanting to save money and nerd out and learn something about electronics/battery tech were the two driving reasons behind this experiment.</p>
<h2>Why do I need a battery at all?</h2>
<p>I’d like to have a massive power bank for when we go camping. I also have a small portable projector for watching movies when we’re car camping. I know purists will disagree, but here we are. Also nerding out.</p>
<h2>Why lithium batteries?</h2>
<p>Briefly, there are two types of batteries:</p>
<ul>
<li>lead acid  - like the starter battery in your car</li>
<li>lithium ion- like the one in your cell phone</li>
</ul>
<p>Lead acid tend to be easier to maintain, while lithium ion are quite finicky. However lead acid battery are typically 3-5 times heavier than an equivalent lithium ion battery. Lithium ion batteries have a better cycle life and are therefore more energy dense.</p>
<p>I also thought I could go on craigslist and purchase some reclaimed lithium ion cells to  bring the overall cost down. </p>
<p>Overall cost to performance ratio is in favour of lithium ion cells.</p>
<p>In the next instalment I’ll describe my prototyping efforts. Here’s the teaser, a functional 4S6P 18650 battery.</p>
