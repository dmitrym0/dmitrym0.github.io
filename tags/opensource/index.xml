      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed to open source software much until last year. It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting and rewarding process.
Last year when I released my scheduling package for Emacs, org-hyperscheduler. Later in 2022 I found a fantastic package for taking notes, org-noter.
When I dicovered org-noter in the summer of 2022, it was not actively maintained. The last update was at the end of 2019. I asked if anyone wanted to collaborate on a fork on github and made a post on reddit.</description>

      <description>I did it. My Emacs package, org-hyperscheduler, is now live on MELPA, here.
I&amp;rsquo;m overjoyed. It&amp;rsquo;s a big deal for me, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time beneficiary of open source software and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to finally be able to give back. It&amp;rsquo;s the first piece of software that I started out writing for myself and got to a state where it&amp;rsquo;s useable for other folks.
Once version 1 was stable, I submitted a pull request to MELPA.</description>
