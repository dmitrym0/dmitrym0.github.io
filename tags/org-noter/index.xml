      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed to open source software much until last year. It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting and rewarding process.
My first large contribution was last year when I released my scheduling package for Emacs, org-hyperscheduler. Later in 2022 I found a fantastic package for taking notes, org-noter.
When I dicovered org-noter in the summer of 2022, it was not actively maintained. The last update was at the end of 2019. I asked if anyone wanted to collaborate on a fork on github and made a post on reddit.</description>
