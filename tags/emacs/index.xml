      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking notes consistently, probably starting in university. The challenge for me was never capture but retrieval. I suspect that&amp;rsquo;s true for most people.
The interesting thing about zettelcasten is how Luhramn optimized his sytem for retrieval. Related subjects were proximate, he used a linking system of sorts that allowed his cards to be filed under number of different topics.
In digital note taking, proximity is difficult to simulate. Hyperlinking is the first step of course.</description>

      <description>I started using Emacs and org-mode in earnest in the middle of 2019. At that point in time I was using Omnifocus to track my tasks and Bearapp for notes. I was missing plaintext functionality. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced most of the functionality that Omnifocus offerred except one particular feature: reviews.
In GTD, reviews occupy a pretty important niche. Without regular task and project reviews task lists tend to grow out of control and become polutted.</description>
