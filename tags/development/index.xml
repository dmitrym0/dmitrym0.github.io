      <title>Achievement Unlocked: Open Source Contribution</title>

      <description>I did it. My Emacs package, org-hyperscheduler, is now live on MELPA, here.
I&amp;rsquo;m overjoyed. It&amp;rsquo;s a big deal for me, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time beneficiary of open source software and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to finally be able to give back. It&amp;rsquo;s the first piece of software that I started out writing for myself and got to a state where it&amp;rsquo;s useable for other folks.
Once version 1 was stable, I submitted a pull request to MELPA.</description>

      <title>Managing  secrets in open source iOS apps</title>

      <description>One of the issues that open source authors have to deal with is secrets management. The small utility app I&amp;rsquo;m working on relies on Dropbox API. Before you can work with Dropbox API though, you have to generate an API key. The API key identifies the application to Dropbox and needs to remain mostly secret. A bad actor could impersonate the application author by stealing the API key.
This is a long winded way of saying that API keys must be kept out of public repositories.</description>

      <title>Swift optionals for Objective-C programmers</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying my hand at some iOS programming after being away for a while. At this point it does not make sense to start a new project in Objective-C so I started in Swift.
Overall, Swift is very readable and I&amp;rsquo;m fairly productive right out of the gate. One of the new language features that not familiar though, is Optionals.
Due to Objective-C&amp;rsquo;s, C lineage you could do things like this:</description>

      <title>Safari App Extensions; migrating from .safariextz</title>

      <description>I’ve dabbled with a Safari extension for a project on and off for a while. For Safari 12, I read that .safariextz-style extensions are no longer supported. I went forth to investigate what changed and how I could port my old extension to Safari 12.
The short story is that the packaging has changed, but the bulk of the existing extension should just work once new conventions are adopted. I imagine the new changes are spurred by Apple’s desire to unify distribution — new extensions are wrapped as a mac application, require a signature and are distributed through the Mac App Store.</description>

      <title>How to check for X-Send-File (or X-Accel-Redirect)</title>

      <description>Some web requests should not be handled by the application framework. Requests hitting a dynamic API endpoint should be processed by application (in my case typically Ruby on Rails). Static assets (such as files) should be served by the webserver, bypassing Ruby on Rails completely.
Why?
There are a couple of reasons.
The biggest one is performance. NGINX and Apache are significantly better and faster at serving files than a Ruby process.</description>

      <title>Efficient commit workflow with tig</title>

      <description>One of the recommended source control practices is to commit frequently, and often. I prefer to keep my commits terse and focused, however in practice I’m working on a couple related but independent things in parallel. At commit time, I prefer to tease loosely related things apart and commit them separately.
One way to do that is with the interactive git-add facility that can be invoked with git add -p:</description>

      <title>Working with shared memory on OS X</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Qt&amp;rsquo;s QSharedMemory, on Mac OS X you&amp;rsquo;re working with System V shared memory subsystem. If your data is sizable, the first limit you&amp;rsquo;ll hit in the maximum segment size, which is for some reason around 4 megs. To increase it invoke this magic incantation:
1  sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=33554432   and to see other shared mem related kernel variables:
1  sysctl -A|grep shm   If you&amp;rsquo;d like these settings to remain after you reboot your machine follow the instruction here.</description>
