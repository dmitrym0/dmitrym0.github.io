      <description>I started using Emacs and org-mode in earnest in the middle of 2019. At that point in time I was using Omnifocus to track my tasks and Bearapp for notes. I was missing plaintext functionality. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced most of the functionality that Omnifocus offerred except one particular feature: reviews.
In GTD, reviews occupy a pretty important niche. Without regular task and project reviews task lists tend to grow out of control and become polutted.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s lots to love about agile, but my personal faves are two things:
 timeboxed iterations retrospectives  The ultimate goal of agile is to shorten feedback loops. If something is not working it&amp;rsquo;s easier to identify and correct the issue at the point of occurence rather than months down the line. This of it as a REPL loop for productivity.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite successful doing this at work, so I figured why not try it for personal productivity as well?</description>
