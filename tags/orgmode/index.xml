      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been pretty hard to focus on anything other than what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world the last two weeks. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really successfully complete the iteration. We&amp;rsquo;ve been sent home from work about a week ago which freed up a lot of time that&amp;rsquo;s been allocated to the commute. Theoretically. Unfortunately focus has been hard to come by.
The only take away I have from this iteration is that I&amp;rsquo;ve significantly reversed my position on UI/UX.</description>

      <description>Interesting iteration. Overall agile approach has been a net positive. I likely would&amp;rsquo;ve have been approximately as successful, but deliberate approach to planning and reviews yields interesting artifacts (of which this blog post is one) and provides for an interesting trajectory overview.
I made good progress on my tasks this iteration:
 adding two additional chapters reviewed to &amp;ldquo;First 90 days&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s becoming a bit tedious, but I feel it&amp;rsquo;s critical to finish this book.</description>

      <description>The goal for this iteration was to:
 work on my little SwiftUI app finish reading a book (&amp;ldquo;The first 90 days&amp;rdquo;) maintain my fitness habits    Conclusions Overall the iteration went well. In the screenshot above, you can tell that I wildly underestimated how much time summarizing the current book would take: I estimated an hour, but it ended up being 3 times as much (3 hours).</description>

      <description>:LOGBOOK: nil:END:
There&amp;rsquo;s lots to love about agile, but my personal faves are two things:
 timeboxed iterations retrospectives  The ultimate goal of agile is to shorten feedback loops. If something is not working it&amp;rsquo;s easier to identify and correct the issue at the point of occurence rather than months down the line. This of it as a REPL loop for productivity.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite successful doing this at work, so I figured why not try it for personal productivity as well?</description>

      <title>Omnifocus style reviews with org-mode</title>

      <description>I started using Emacs and org-mode in earnest in the middle of 2019. At that point in time I was using Omnifocus to track my tasks and Bearapp for notes. I was missing plaintext functionality. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced most of the functionality that Omnifocus offerred except one particular feature: reviews.
In GTD, reviews occupy a pretty important niche. Without regular task and project reviews task lists tend to grow out of control and become polutted.</description>
